<h3>
    When C# Game-Dev Meets AI Focused Web Dev
</h3>

<p>

I have professional experience with Fullstack engineering, transformer model training and prompting (Generative AI), Salesforce development, architecting complex systems, deploying and monitoring large projects, software project management, and legal technology startups. I have led several teams in both software development and in the service industry. 

I also love creating [community-driven applications (2021)](https://off-your-chest.herokuapp.com) and getting people interacting with eachother online. I'm also a mega-nerd for physics-based video games! I join both game jams and competitions (like Google Hash) regularly. Reach out so we can team up!
