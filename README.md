    When MERN Stack meets C# Game Development
</h3>

<p>

I LOVE creating [community-driven applications](https://off-your-chest.herokuapp.com) and getting people interacting with eachother online. I'm also a mega-nerd for physics-based video games!

        My skills 
    <img src="./svg/sparkles.gif" width="25">
</h3>
<p>
    In <b>Full-Stack Web Development</b> I have deployed and lead several team projects using Scrum methodology and various Project Management tools. I have familiarity with a few databases (mongo, sql, postgres) and am pretty confident in my back-end know how -- but I really love front end development and React.
</p>
<p>
    In <b>C# Unity & Game Development</b> I have worked on two medium physics based games, as well as a dozen or so smaller personal projects. I have also developed private proprietary software to track user intention based off of various human inputs.
