    I LOVE creating <a src="https://off-your-chest.herokuapp.com/">community-driven applications</a> and getting people interacting with eachother online. I'm also a mega-nerd for physics-based video games! 
</p>

<p align="center">
    I am currently working with a team of 3 as lead developer on a <i>"fast paced gorey-fps-roguelike where consuming life essence from arena enemies upgrades your physical mutations for a huge amount of bloody synergies"</i>. It is in closed testing right now, but stay tuned!!

<!-- ABOUT MY SKILLS -->

    <h2>My skills</h2>
    <p>
        In <b>Full-Stack Web Development</b> I have deployed and lead several team projects using Scrum methodology and various Project Management tools. I have familiarity with a few databases (mongo, sql, postgres) and am pretty confident in my back-end know how -- but I really love front end development and React.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <b>C# Unity & Game Development</b> I have worked on two medium physics based games, as well as a dozen or so smaller personal projects. I have also developed private proprietary software to track user intention based off of various human inputs.
